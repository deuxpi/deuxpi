# :wave: Hi, I'm Philippe.

The projects I'm sharing here are either tools that I found useful at some point or
experiments with some technology. Most of the time I will use Python or Ruby.

I work at [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) as a Senior Developer working on Checkouts.

## :sparkles: Current project

I've been working on a web application for helping manage a simple balanced investment portfolio. 

## :coffee: 

You can @ me on Twitter as [@deuxpi](https://twitter.com/deuxpi).

**Shopify stuff:** I'd love to chat about the workplace or your own experience with the Shopify checkout. 

**Other stuff:** Talk to me about mechanical keyboards, parenting, coffee, space exploration, etc.


Nice to meet you!
